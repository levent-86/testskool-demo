# TestSkool Demo
This repository showcases the "Edit Profile" feature of TestSkool, a platform for teachers to create quizzes and students to solve them.

## Overview
The "Edit Profile" feature of "My Profile" page allows users to:
- Update their first name, last name, and about section
- Upload a profile picture
- Select a subject (for teachers)
- Change their password
- Delete their account

**Note**: This feature requires backend authentication and API integration, so the code is not runnable standalone. Watch the demo video below for a walkthrough.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Material-UI, TypeScript, Axios, Eslint, Vite
- **Testing**: Vitest, HappyDOM, MSW, user-event, css-mediaquery, vitest/coverage-v8 and React Testing Library for TDD
- **Containerization**: Docker for environment consistency

## Code Highlights
- **Modular Components**: Reusable React components with Material-UI
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript for robust user data handling
- **State Management**: Context and hooks for user data
- **TDD**: Unit tests for the My Profile feature (see `src/__tests__/` directory)
- **Docker**: Containerized setup for development and deployment
